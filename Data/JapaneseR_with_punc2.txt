i travel a lot and have eaten at a lot of hibachi restaurants. i happen to have a project in the pittsburgh area and was looking for a hibachi place to take my co-workers. i read several reviews on other hibachi places and they all sound the same. the typical they are so busy the service sucks and they rush you in and out to turn tables quickly.  i found sapporo and was very pleased! it is in an odd location but once you step inside, you feel the ambiance of cozy and family style. my party felt the staff was very friendly.  i had ordered the filet and shrimp with fried rice. the others in my group ordered chicken broccoli, and the sapporo deluxe which consists of lobster, filet and shrimp. we all got started with the soup and salads, which was a pretty good size. i didn't want to finish it all because i wanted to save room for dinner. our chef was one of the most personable chef's i have encountered. he was very talkative and really wanted to get to know us. my file was delicious and the fried rice was excellent. they make their fried rice from scratch. it's not prepared ahead of time like i see at most hibachi places. i can definitely tell the difference. my friend sam who ordered the chicken broccoli could not stop raving about the sauce that they used. it is unlike soy sauce or teriyaki sauce. we asked the chef about the sauce and sure enough it is one of a kind. dan, who ordered the sapporo deluxe was very pleased with his meal and couldn't even finish it. actually we all needed to-go boxes. the portion amount here is incredible. you definitely get your money's worth here!!  i would highly recommend this place to hibachi lovers because this place is surely a secret in pittsburgh. i can not stress how different this place is compared to other hibachi places. i think this restaurant is family owned and not a chain which i can always appreciate.   thank you sapporo for a great hibachi experience!! i will be back for sure!  anh

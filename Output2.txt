sushi rolls are a strenting about the sushi bar.  after we finished the chocolate pretzel stack is always a good sign for some reason for the food that is a great place to go when you want to get a drink at RESTAURANT_NAME is a great place to go back to see a bit spot and the chef was very friendly and the service was great, but the prices are extremely small and i was surprised to see that there was a lot of sesame oil.  i would definitely return here for a date or the fried rice and some sort of crunchy of salmon topped with a salad was delicious and the service was great, but i don't think it's worth the price point. the sushi is always fresh and the service was great, but the prices are extremely small and i was surprised to see that there was a lot of sesame oil.  i would definitely return here for a date or the fried rice and some sort of crunchy of salmon topped with a salad was delicious and the service was great, but i don't think it's worth the price point.

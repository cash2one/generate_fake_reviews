  i love the sushi bar.  after we found a seat by ourselves we awaited approximately for about 10 minutes for a waiter to give us our menus.  after receiving our menus from our mute friendly waiter we were asked what we would like to order.  

not ok.  i wouldn't return, so it was a bit overpriced cocktail with some of the bowl which makes the same sauce alone. a secance dinner on the menu.  

i have been here twice and a small restaurant in a strip mall, but the portion was pretty good. i liked the fried rice when had an absolute flavor.   the food was also very good.  the salmon was all simple for you.  looks and taste both scored a 3 out of 10.
